# 🗣️ Lingua Bot

**Lingua Bot** is a simple web app that lets you input text, have it spoken aloud, and then instantly translated and spoken in another language — using **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** and **translation API**.

It's a fast, voice-based language assistant built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
